# DTO folder (Data Transfer Objects)

This folder contains Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used for transferring data between different layers of the application, particularly in HTTP requests and responses. DTOs help to encapsulate the data and ensure that only the necessary information is exposed to the client or other parts of the system.
